# motion_comp
This project focuses on motion compensation of the robot hand of Davinci for movements of organs during surgery. This is helpful as the surgeon need not worry about syncing his motion with that of the organ or worry about unpredictable movements of the eye during surgery. An EKF is implemented to predict the position of the organ. This is implemented along with the tele-operation of the davinci arms. This has been done through Gazebo using ROS and visualized in Rviz as well.
